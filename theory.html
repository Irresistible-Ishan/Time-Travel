  <h1>THEORY OF HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE TIME TRAVEL- </h1><br><br>

4th dimensional velocity which dont include light speed <br>
Light speed is 3rd dimentional velocity <br><br><br>


We can travel back or front in time by moving at light speed or fast (according to theory of relativity), but there is no reason for us to travel at that speed when we can just reach that speed without travelling at that speed .<br><br>


This means i found the way to travel in time which works like,<br><br>


We can travel at speed of light or faster 
In 4th dimension 
Just standing at a point of 4th dimension 
We can move in time 
As someone else travels in time 
We will observe him just disappearing in thin air. <br>
<br>


<h3>How we do that -</h3><br>
<br>

To move in the 4th dimension we goota take help from quantum machenics <br>

We are gonna move every single particle of body to small 4th dimension and it will help us move in time <br><br>
<br>





<h3>Detailed-</h3> <br>

Soo<br>

According to Einstein we have to move at light speed to move forward in time and go faster than that to go back and stay constant to stop time according to me <br>


So , here my theory suggest 
That just like we are moving in spacetime and earth curves space time and which forms gravity<br>

Actually earth is moving with us with a constant speed.<br>

So now we get a question that why we dont de-attach from earth when we rotate and go with it around other side <br>

That is because earth and us are moving in a 4th dimentional space direction so no matter where we stay in 3rd dimension on earth we will still stay attached to gravity <br>

Because the movement of earth in 4d makes gravity <br>

Now <br>
<br>

According to first paragraph <br>

We can move at light speed to move forward in time 
So i suggest i instead of moving with a light speed in 3rd dimension.<br>

We somehow manage to move at light speed in 4th dimension No matter where we move <br>

If Einstein is correct then when we do reach light speed ,<br>

We will eventually time travel <br>
<br>


When we apply this extended theory of time Travel 
When a person do this the observers will see him suddenly disappear from thin air 
Because he moved in time but from the perspective of that person he will see the world changing time like a real time machine or time travel shown in fiction . <br>
<br>


Now how we do this really, well i have some methods here - <br>
<br>
<br>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
By quantum acceleration we will accelerate the quantum level small particles of our body to light speed which will lead us to time travel</lil> <br>

Why do we need quantum particle accelerator this is because if the theory of quantumy 4th dimension is true then we can only move in 4th dimension with small particles which is size of the same as 4d <br>
<br>


<li>if quantum 4d theory is not true then we have to find out which direction the earth and us are moving in 4d and for that we need to make a 4th dimensional gyroscope which locks at a point of space-time and the opposite of it will be the direction in which the earth is moving 
We just have to move in that direction of 4d with light speed. 

And thats how we time travel according to my
theory 
<br>


About possibilities of world reality about time <br>

It maybe be that timeline expands like a snow flake it doesn't have fixed shape and it extends as it wants </li></ol>

<h3>Why light is a 4d 
Understand Einstein's method-</h3> <br>
<br>


New concept reimagined <br>

Light is the thing which acts as 4th dimentional object .
Time is not different for everyone actually light speed is different but same 

If a alien very far away see us then he will see the light of past come in that direction.<br>

But actually the time is as same as his <br><br>



Like Einstein's example if we are in train and lighting hits platform 2 at same time we see the first lightning hit first and before the second because of the distance and time taken by light to travel<br>
<br>



<h3>About space time- </h3><br>

Space time has infinite size it can be stretched infinite and be concentrated at a point infinite <br>
<br>

As black hole are nothing but a point of infinitely concentration of space time 
And universe expands because of inertia because no external force is stopping it and space time stretched infinitely .

This is also reason why spiral curvature are possible
